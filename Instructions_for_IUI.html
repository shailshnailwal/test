	<h4>Instructions for patients undergoing IUI </h4>
	<h4>Timing of IUI </h4>
	<p>The timing of the IUI procedure relative to ovulation is important so that the sperm arrive at the site of fertilization soon 
	after ovulation occurs.  Proper timing of IUI minimizes aging of the sperm and egg so that fertilization has the greatest chance of success.  
	Your doctor will discuss with you the best way to time ovulation for your IUI procedure. </p>
	<h4>IUI Appointment Scheduling </h4>
	<p>The two appointments are scheduled 90 minutes apart to allow for collection of the semen sample and laboratory preparation of the sperm for IUI.  
	It is very important that each of the partners arrive on time for their appointments so the IUI procedure can be performed soon after the sperm are 
	washed and prepared for IUI.</p>
	<h4>Semen Collection </h4>
	<p>For husband semen, the best results are obtained when the specimen is collected at our clinic.  Sperm do not survive well in the seminal 
	fluids and sperm are also sensitive to changes in temperature, so delay in delivering semen to the laboratory or exposure of the specimen to 
	environmental temperatures can damage the sperm.  We have special collection rooms at the clinic that are private, sanitary and comfortable. </p>
	<p>Abstinence:  It will maximize the quality of the semen if the man does not have sexual intercourse or ejaculate for 2-3 days prior to the 
	appointment.  Unless you are instructed otherwise by your physician or nurse, the IUI specimen should be collected at least 2 days after the 
	last ejaculation. Directions for collecting the semen specimen will be available in the collection room.  It is important to follow the directions 
	carefully.  Each step is important to ensure the best possible specimen for the IUI.  The samples collected outside the clinic will not be 
	entertained for IUI. </p>
	<h4>Procedure </h4>
	<p>The woman is taken to an exam room and asked to undress from the waist down.  It is recommended that you have a partially full bladder.  
	The nurse or physician will show you the laboratory report giving the results of the semen preparation.  A vaginal speculum will be inserted 
	and the cervix located visually.  A soft catheter will be threaded through the cervix into the uterus.  This may cause some cramping, but is 
	usually tolerated well by patients.  The semen will be slowly injected into the uterus and the catheter removed.  You will be asked to 
	relax in the exam room for 10 minutes before getting dressed.</p>
	<h4>After the IUI </h4>
	<p>If your period is delayed after your IUI, you may perform a home pregnancy test or come to our clinic for a pregnancy test.  
	If your menstrual flow starts, call your nurse to discuss your follow-up care. </p>
