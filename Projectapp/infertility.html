 	<h4>MALE INFERTILITY TREATMENTS </h4>
 	
 	<p>
The male partner has a wide variety of treatment options for mild male factor infertility. 
But if there are no specific medicines if there are no endocrine problems. Generally anti oxidant tables are widely prescribed. 
If there is oligospermia associated with hypogonadism, clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins are effective. 
Associated conditions like prostatic infections or erectile dysfunction etc have to be taken care of. 
Surgical treatments like varicocele surgery may be effective in approximately 15% of males with mild oligospermia. 
But those patients with severe male factor have to opt for assisted reproductive techniques like ICSI or IMSI at the earliest

<h4>Ovulation Induction</h4>
<p>

Ovulation induction is a technique that uses hormonal therapy to stimulate egg development and release. 
Ovulation induction drugs also referred to as fertility drugs are used to stimulate the follicles in the ovaries which in turn lead to the production of multiple eggs in one cycle. The medications are also administered to control the time of egg release so intrauterine inseminations and in vitro fertilization procedures can be scheduled at the most likely time to achieve high rates of successful pregnancy.These fertility drugs were initially designed to induce ovulation in women who did not ovulate on their own such as those with irregular  menstrual cycles. The primary goal was to produce a healthy egg.
</p>
 <p>
The following common fertility drugs that are used for ovulation induction are as follows:<br />
•	Clomiphene Citrate<br />
•	Human Chorionic Gonadotropin<br />
•	Leuprolide and Synthetic Gonadotropin Inhibitor<br />
•	Human Menopausal Gonadotropin<br />
•	Follicle Stimulating Hormone</p>
<h4>Risks of ovulation induction: </h4>
<p>There are several risks associated with the use of ovulation induction drugssuch as an increase in the chance for high order multiple births and the formation of ovarian cysts. In rare cases, condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs whose symptoms include severe pain in abdomen and chest, pelvis, nausea, weight gain, vomiting and difficulty breathing.</p>
