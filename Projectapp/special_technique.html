﻿﻿﻿﻿<h4>IMSI &#8211; Intra-cytoplasmic Morphologically Selected Sperm Injection</h4>
<p>IMSI takes ICSI to the next level. ICSI involves us injecting sperm directly into your egg, before we transfer it into your womb. During IMSI, we use a very high power microscope to magnify the sperm around 7000 times. The equipment is more complex and expensive when compared to ICSI This allows us to see in great detail how the sperm looks and to select the best sperm for the ICSI procedure.  IMSI is a very new development and is showing promise for a specific group of patients. If we feel you are going to benefit from IMSI we’ll discuss this with you.  Once the best sperm has been selected the IMSI procedure is carried out in exactly the same way as ICSI.<br />
 
<p>IMSI is available at ARMC IVF. ARMC is the only centre, which you offer IMSI treatment with no additional cost. The first IMSI baby of Malabar region was born out of the treatment at ARMC IVF Calicut in the year 2012. If you would like more information, please contact us.</p>
<h4>Laser Assisted Hatching(LAH)</h4>
<p>The advent of the laser has allowed the development of precision techniques to manipulate embryos for enhanced fertility. Laser-assisted hatching can turn around a history of failure for embryos to implant themselves in the uterine wall.<br />
Assisted hatching is used to help the embryo hatch from its protective outer shell, the zona pellucida, and promote implantation in the uterine wall after embryo transfer. Laser-assisted hatching (LAH) with the LYKOS® or ZILOS-tk® uses a highly focused infrared laser beam to remove the zona pellucida in very precise increments. Prior to the clinical availability of the lasers, only mechanical or chemical methods could be used for assisted hatching of human embryos in clinical settings. Laser-assisted hatching requires less handling of the embryo than these other assisted hatching methods. Also, laser-assisted hatching is faster than the other methods and, therefore, the embryo spends less time outside the incubator.</p>
<h4>Indications for LAH</h4>
<p>• Women over 37 years old<br />
• Women with an elevated baseline level of FSH
(follicular stimulating hormone)<br />
• Women with poor prognosis embryos, including conditions such as a thick zona pellucida,slow cell division rate, or high cell fragmentation<br />
• Women who have failed 1 or more IVF cycles<br />
• Women using frozen/thawed embryos, which may have hardened zona pellucida</p>
<h4>Cryopreservation of Eggs, Sperm and Embryos</h4>
<p>Our lab is equipped with the latest technology for cryopreservation and storage, and we were the first clinics to establish an Egg Freezing Program for the general public in North Kerala. By freezing eggs, sperm and embryos in appropriate cases, we can help simplify and lower the cost of future IVF cycles. We have the expert embryology team well experienced in the latest technology in gamete or embryo freezing ie Vitrification.</p>
<h4>Cryopreservation of Eggs</h4>
<p>Egg freezing benefits two main groups of women. The first are those who are diagnosed with a medical condition whereby the necessary treatments for cure may render them sterile or unable to produce viable eggs. The second is women who are delaying their childbearing for personal reasons, meaning saving eggs now for pregnancy chances at a later time. It is best to have eggs that are frozen when they are of the best quality possible. For instance, eggs frozen at the age of 35 are more usable than fresh oocytes produced at 43 years of age.<br />
As egg freezing technology improves, it may also be used by patients who are undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Women who produce many excess eggs may eventually be able to elect to freeze their eggs unfertilized, rather than freezing fertilized embryos.</p>
<h4>Cryopreservation of Sperm</h4>
<p>Our onsite services are available for the short-term storage of sperm specimens as long as the female partner remains our patient. We offer cryopreservation of sperm for men with poor sperm counts who may need a back-up sample stored, those who wish to store a sample before beginning cancer treatment and in cases where the man may be out-of-town at the time of egg retrieval. If long-term storage of your sperm specimen or donor sperm is required, we can help you access quality services, though we do not have an onsite sperm bank.</p>
<h4>Cryopreservation of Embryos</h4>
<p>Embryo cryopreservation is used most often to store good-quality excess embryos resulting from an IVF-ICSI treatment cycle. Embryos are created after an in vitro fertilization cycle where eggs are retrieved and then placed with sperm. The resultant embryos are then vitrified before being placed in liquid nitrogen for storage. </p>
			<p>Recurrent Pregnancy Loss</p>

<p>Recurrent pregnancy loss is a disease distinct from infertility, defined by two or more failed pregnancies. When the cause is unknown, each pregnancy loss merits careful review to determine whether specific evaluation may be appropriate. After three or more losses, a thorough evaluation is warranted.Although approximately 25% of all recognized pregnancies result in miscarriage, less than 5% of women will experience two consecutive miscarriages, and only 1% experience three or more. Couples who experience recurrent pregnancy loss may benefit from a medical evaluation and psychological support.</p>
<h4>Genetic/Chromosomal Causes:</h4>
<p>A chromosome analysis performed from the parents’ blood identifies an inherited genetic cause in less than 5% of couples. Translocation (when part of one chromosome is attached to another chromosome) is the most common inherited chromosome abnormality. Although a parent who carries a translocation is frequently normal, their embryo may receive too much or too little genetic material. When this occurs, a miscarriage usually occurs. Couples with translocations or other specific chromosome defects may benefit from pre-implantation genetic diagnosis in conjunction with in vitro fertilization.<br />
In contrast to the uncommon finding of an inherited genetic cause, many early miscarriages are due to the random (by chance) occurrence of a chromosomal abnormality in the embryo. In fact, 60% or more of early miscarriages may be caused by a random chromosomal abnormality, usually a missing or duplicated chromosome.</p>
<h4>Age:</h4>
<p>The chance of a miscarriage increases as a woman ages. After age 40, more than one-third of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Most of these embryos have an abnormal number of chromosomes.</p>
<h4>Hormonal Abnormalities:</h4>
<p>Progesterone, a hormone produced by the ovary after ovulation, is necessary for a healthy pregnancy. There is controversy about whether low progesterone levels, often called luteal phase deficiency, may cause repeated miscarriages. Treatments may include ovulation induction, progesterone supplementation or injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), but there is no evidence to support the effectiveness of these treatments.</p>
<h4>Metabolic Abnormalities:</h4>
<p>Poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of miscarriage. Women with diabetes improve pregnancy outcomes if blood sugars are controlled before conception. Women who have insulin resistance, such as obese women and many who have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), also have higher rates of miscarriage. There is still not enough evidence to know if medications that improve insulin sensitivity lower miscarriage risks in women with PCOS (see Fact Sheet “Insulin Sensitizing Agents”).</p>
<h4>Uterine Abnormalities:</h4>
<p>Distortion of the uterine cavity may be found in approximately 10% to 15% of women with recurrent pregnancy losses. Diagnostic screening tests include hysterosalpingogram, sonohysterography (See Fact Sheets “Hysterosalpingogram,” and “Saline Infusion Sonohysterography”), ultrasound, or hysteroscopy. Congenital uterine abnormalities include a double uterus, uterine septum, and a uterus in which only one side has formed. Asherman’s syndrome (scar tissue in the uterine cavity), uterine fibroids, and possibly uterine polyps are acquired abnormalities that may also cause recurrent miscarriages. Some of these conditions may be surgically corrected.</p>
<h4>Antiphospholipid Syndrome:</h4>
<p>Blood tests for anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant may identify women with antiphospholipid syndrome, a cause for 3% to 15% of recurrent miscarriages. A second blood test performed at least 6 weeks later confirms the diagnosis. In women who have high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy outcomes are improved by the use of aspirin and heparin.</p>
<h4>Thrombophilias:</h4>
<p>Inherited disorders that raise a woman&#8217;s risk of serious blood clots (thrombosis) may also increase the risk of fetal death in the second half of pregnancy. However, there is no proven benefit for testing or treatment of women with thrombophilias and recurrent miscarriage in the first half of pregnancy.</p>
<h4>Male factor:</h4>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal integrity (intactness) of sperm DNA may affect embryo development and possibly increase miscarriage risk. However, these data are still very preliminary, and it is not known how often sperm defects contribute to recurrent miscarriage.</p>
<h4>Unexplained:</h4>
<p>No explanation is found in 50% to 75% of couples with recurrent pregnancy losses.</p>
<h4>Tests with no proven benefit for recurrent miscarriage:</h4>
<p>The couples should be aware that there are a lot of treatment modalities without any proven benefit. These include cultures for bacteria or viruses, tests for insulin resistance, antinuclear antibodies, antithyroid antibodies, maternal antipaternal antibodies, antibodies to infectious agents, and embryotoxic factors.Treatments with no proven benefit include leukocyte (white blood cell) immunization and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy.</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>A couple may be comforted to know that the next pregnancy is successful in 60% to 70% of those with unexplained recurrent pregnancy losses. A healthy lifestyle and folic acid supplementation is recommended before attempting another pregnancy. Smoking cessation, reduced alcohol and caffeine consumption, moderate exercise, and weight control may all be of benefit. Counseling may provide comfort and help cope with the grief, anger, isolation, fear, and helplessness that many individuals experience after repeated miscarriages.</p>

<p>IVF Treatment Failure</p>

<h4>My IVF Treatment Failed&#8230; Now What?:</h4>
<p>An unsuccessful IVF cycle, after all the preparations it takes, is often emotionally and financially devastating. We know this well, because most of our patients come to us after having failed IVF cycles elsewhere. We also know, however, that failed IVF cycles can provide clues for a successful next IVF treatment.</p>
<p>Our confidence on this issue derives from the fact that we have helped so many patients over the years to conceive, despite long histories of unsuccessful fertility treatments. Indeed, many patients come to ARMC after their initial fertility centers have given up on them, and refuse further treatments (unless, of course, patients agreed to donor eggs!). If you are one of these patients with multiple failed IVF cycles, consider contacting CHR for a second opinion!</p>
<h4>What is a failed IVF cycle?:</h4>
<p>&#8220;Failed IVF&#8221; is a vague term that can refer to several different situations:</p>
<p>• IVF cycle cancellation, prior to egg retrieval, because not enough follicles are produced;</p>
<p>• No or only inadequate quality eggs are retrieved;</p>
<p>• Retrieved eggs don&#8217;t fertilize or fertilize inadequately;</p>
<p>• As a consequence no embryo may be available for transfer into the uterus;</p>
<p>• For a variety of reasons transferred embryos may not implant;</p>
<p>• And that, of course, will mean no pregnancy after embryo transfer.</p>
<h4>IVF cycle cancellation:</h4>
<p>Amongst patients who come to us after cycle cancellation, a number of major problems stand out: The one most frequently encountered is that most IVF centers routinely cancel IVF cycles if the patient does not demonstrate a minimal number of follicles on ultrasound. Such cancellations make sense, if a better ovarian stimulation can be applied in a subsequent cycle. For a woman with already diminished ovarian reserve, such a cancellation may only waste the patient&#8217;s last good chance of pregnancy, because time is usually not on her side!</p>
<p>Often patients are not given an ovarian stimulation protocol that suits their &#8220;ovarian age.&#8221; The reason for this error is that IVF stimulation protocols are usually chosen based on a patient&#8217;s age. However, younger women may suffer from undiagnosed premature ovarian aging (POA): Their ovaries behave &#8220;older&#8221; than they should. Those ovaries then need to be stimulated like ovaries of an older woman, and that is very frequently overlooked. For a successful IVF treatment, patients must be given ovarian stimulation protocols based on their ovarian age, not their physiological age!</p>
<p>There is another worrisome trend that has developed In recent years: some centers have started to propagate so-called &#8220;mini-IVF.&#8221; Proponents argue that milder ovarian stimulation is better, and results in better pregnancy chances. There is only one problem with this concept (as attractive as it may sound): None of these proponents has ever reported data that would really confirm these claims! Trying to confirm this concept, investigators, indeed, recently did a cooperative study of such &#8220;mini-IVF&#8221; and regular IVF cycles and were unable, even in young women with entirely normal ovarian reserve, to demonstrate either clinical or economic benefits of &#8220;mini-IVF.&#8221; Very much to the contrary! &#8220;Mini-IVF&#8221; produced lower pregnancy rates and showed no cost advantages.</p>
<p>Yet, &#8220;mini-IVF&#8221; is widely propagated for women with much poorer prognosis &#8211; women with DOR &#8211; and they can be expected to do even worse than the young, normal women investigated in this CHR study. With mild ovarian stimulation, DOR patients face an approximately 50% cycle cancellation rate, unheard of in any responsible IVF format!</p>
<p>Our approach is different. We are not afraid to use more aggressive forms of ovarian stimulation, if test results and thorough examinations of the patients show that low ovarian reserve requires such treatment. By careful monitoring during ovarian stimulation, most negative side effects of stronger ovarian stimulations can be avoided. This is exactly what our experts do. We will go after even a single egg in some patients, if a patient manages to produce one follicle. While pregnancy chances are obviously small with retrieval of only one egg (and the risk of not retrieving an egg from a single follicle is considerable), it takes only one egg and one embryo to establish pregnancy. Many of our patients can confirm this fact.</p>
<p>A large majority of our patients come to our center because they already know, from prior IVF experiences elsewhere, that they produce only very small numbers of eggs, and that they need a fertility center that will fight for those few remaining eggs.</p>
<p>With the help of Dehydroepinadrosterone (DHEA) and our individualized ovarian stimulation protocols, we have learned to get the most out of these patients&#8217; ovaries. Most patients who come to CHR after previous experiences will tell you that they, at CHR, end up with more eggs and embryos, and they are of better quality. Every egg and embryo counts, because every egg and embryo represents pregnancy chances!</p>
<h4>Poor quality eggs and poor quality embryos:</h4>
<p>An IVF cycle can be unsuccessful even with good numbers of eggs (and embryos) if egg quality is poor. Egg quality reflects about 95% of the final quality of an embryo. Poor egg quality, therefore, always leads to poor embryo quality. The quality of sperm, while not unimportant, is minuscule in comparison to egg quality.</p>
<p>Embryos from low-quality eggs often fail to develop properly. In an IVF cycle, embryos are observed for 3 to 5 days as they grow, before they are transferred into the uterus. On the third day, good-quality embryos should reach 6- to 8-cell stage, and have a more or less regular shape. Embryos that don&#8217;t reach this stage within the first few days of development cannot be used for embryo transfer. In addition, some embryos that do reach this stage may be aneuploid (have chromosomal abnormalities). Aneuploid embryos, if they implant at all, are usually miscarried early in the pregnancy, thus also resulting in &#8220;failed&#8221; IVF.</p>
<p>Therefore, as many of our patients already know, it is not just the number of eggs that is important. The quality of eggs is also crucial for the success of IVF. In this context, DHEA treatment in women with DOR becomes important. DHEA supplementation increases the IVF pregnancy rates, especially in women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). The use of DHEA supplementation also improves egg quality, improves embryo quality, and reduces aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities) in embryos.</p>
<h4>Conditions that can prevent embryo transfer:</h4>
<p>IVF cancellations can also happen when the patient develops medical complications that make it impossible to transfer embryos to her uterus. Two such conditions are ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and inadequate endometrium.</p>
<p>OHSS is a rare side effect of ovarian stimulation. In most cases, OHSS remains mild and only cause minor to moderate discomfort. However, in women with DOR, OHSS is exceedingly rare, and rarely of concern. When OHSS is more severe, however, embryo transfer may need to be cancelled, and all embryo are frozen for future use. Significant OHSS is usually, though not always, preventable with proper monitoring and adjustments in fertility drugs during ovarian stimulation. Women with polycystic ovaries are generally at highest risk.</p>
<p>The other condition, inadequate endometrium, is also rare but can be a frustrating challenge. Most IVF patients develop good enough endometrium (lining of the uterus) to receive their embryos. When a patient&#8217;s endometrium is slow to develop, various medications can be used to help encourage the proliferation of the endometrium. These conventional medications are enough for a majority of IVF patients, and these patients have their eggs retrieved and embryos transferred.</p>
<p>In a small number of IVF patients, however, endometrium can stay unresponsive to conventional treatments. Since a thickness of 7 mm is considered minimal for a decent chance of embryos implanting, inadequately thin endometrium can be a reason for cancellation of IVF cycles. When embryos are transferred despite inadequate endometrium, the transfer usually result in implantation failure.</p>
<h4>Unexplained IVF failures – Possible autoimmune involvement:</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most frustrating of IVF failures may be the ones for which no apparent reason can be found. A factor, often overlooked in investigation, is the female&#8217;s autoimmunity (immunity against oneself).Female autoimmunity&#8217;s impact on reproduction has been contentious among IVF experts, but published evidence suggests that even subclinical autoimmunity (autoimmunity that doesn&#8217;t require medical treatment and is not obviously apparent) can negatively impacts fertility. At ARMC, patients with evidence of autoimmunity then receive a treatment to keep their autoimmunity in check. This has resulted in many successful IVF births in women with previous autoimmune-related IVF failures.</p>
<h4>What to do when IVF cycles fail?:</h4>
<p>Even when every step—from ovarian stimulation to egg retrieval to embryo transfer—goes as planned, the reality is that a certain percentage of women will not see a positive pregnancy test. IVF pregnancy rates, overall, have improved tremendously in the three decades since the technique was initially introduced; but it still is not perfect. Especially among women with DOR (either due to natural age or due to premature ovarian aging), negative pregnancy tests are unfortunately still common, and patients who still want to work with their own eggs have to expect that it may take more than one cycle to conceive.</p>
<p>The important question is whether we can improve upon unsuccessful cycles. We learn from every unsuccessful cycle. Every IVF cycle that did not lead to pregnancy is discussed and dissected in our weekly conference. This is the only way to get better. And getting constantly better is at the core of ARMC’s existence.</p>
