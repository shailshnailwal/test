	<h4>Instructions for female pelvic  scanning </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Report to the reception and inform the front office staff that you are reporting for scanning </li>
		<li>Purpose: This test provides a picture of the pelvis including the uterus and ovaries. </li>
		<li>The scan is safe and most patients find it to be painless. There is no radiation involved. </li>
		<li>Preparation: Patients should drink 32 ounces of fluid approximately 1 hour prior to the exam. 
		Please do not empty your bladder during this time!! Medications can be taken prior to the examination.</li>
		<li>Procedure: The procedure will take approximately 45 minutes but examination times can vary. After you are in the 
		ultrasound examination room, you will be asked to change into a gown.</li>
		<li>You will then be placed on a stretcherand a water-based gel will be spread over your pelvic area. 
		This gel helps to provide us with quality images.</li>
		<li>A plastic device called a transducer will be placed over your pelvic area and moved back and forth to obtain the 
		images necessary to answer yourphysician's questions. </li>
		<li>Sometimes an adequate study cannot be obtained just by scanning over your pelvic area. If this is the case, another type of pelvic 
		ultrasound may be offered to you. It is called a transvaginal ultrasound examination and entails thefollowing: you must empty your bladder; 
		you will then be placed on a stretcher with stirrups similar to those in your gynecologist's office. We have a transducer specifically 
		designed for this study. These transducers are sterilized between patients and covered with a non-latex sheath during the ultrasound 
		examination. Most patients find the transvaginal ultrasound similar to a pelvic examination done in your gynecologist's office. </li>
		<li>After Care: After the test, you may resume all normal activities. Your attending physician will discuss the results of your 
		ultrasound examination with you. </li>
